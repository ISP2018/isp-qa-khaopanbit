Question2
What is Agile Coding standard
ans-
If programmers all adhere to a single agile coding standard 
(including everything from tabs vs. spaces and curly bracket placement to naming conventions for things like classes, methods, and interfaces)
everything just works better. It's easier to maintain and extend code, to refactor it, and to reconcile integration conflicts
if a common standard is applied consistently throughout. The standard itself matters much less than adherence to it. 
Fortunately, modern IDEs make it trivial to apply many kinds of formatting, even after the fact.

Question3
How do you plan iterations if team size varies?
ans-
Without the ability to rely on consistent team effort, no project approach, agile or otherwise, provides much insight.
 With iterative software development, though, at least there is typically some history that is built up over time to use as a basis for planning.
 With iterative development, if you have delivered several iterations with a team of 10 with an average velocity of 20 ideal days or 200 hours per iteration, and your team is cut in half
Then a simple calculation should lead you to plan no more than 10 ideal days for the upcoming iteration (at least initially). 
If key personnel have be removed, or you find you are wrong, you will find out within the next few weeks and be able to quickly adjust for future iterations

Question4
In Scrum When should tasks be assigned?
ans-
In theory Scrum teams are cross-functional and self-organising
the whole team is responsible for the Sprint Backlog (and achieving the Sprint Goal).
As long as the team can agree on how the work gets done in the Sprint Planning meeting then it’s not strictly necessary to apportion every task to a team member.

Question5
What is increment and what's the different between increment and release
ans-
Increment is the work that the Team produces during the Sprint. The aim to get a potentially shippable increment every Sprint.
The different is Product Owner may release the increment at the end of every Sprint, or gather a few Sprints worth of work before releasing that
